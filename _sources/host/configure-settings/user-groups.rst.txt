Custom User Groups
################################

You can create user groups to include your own list of High Fidelity users. Once a user group is set up, you can :doc:`assign it permissions <permission-settings>` as you would any of the standard user types above. The permissions are applied to every member of the group.

Custom user groups are purchased from High Fidelity for $5/year.

Create a User Group
-------------------------------

To set up a custom group:

1. Go to https://highfidelity.com/user/groups. If you’re not logged in, you will be prompted to do so.
2. Click 'Create New Group or List'.
3. Enter a name for your custom user group.
4. Click 'Checkout Now'.
5. Enter your credit card number, PayPal account information or a coupon code to complete the purchase.
6. High Fidelity offers two types of user groups. Choose the type that best fits your needs:

    * **Group**: Members will receive an invitation to join the group. It is up to the invited user whether or not they join, and they are free to leave the group at any time. Groups are recommended for clubs, bands, teams, etc.
    * **List**: The owner of the user group adds each member account without notifying the user. Lists are recommended for blacklists and whitelists.
7. Click 'Create New Group' or 'Create New List' (depending on the selection above).
8. Confirm your purchase.

-----------------------
Set Up Ranks
-----------------------

Within a group, you can create sub-groups to restrict permissions even further. These sub-groups are called "ranks". For example, a group for a band boosters club may have ranks for "youth" and another for "parents" - two different groups of members within the same organization, each requiring different permissions. 

To set up ranks: 

1. Go to https://highfidelity.com/user/groups. If you’re not logged in, you will be prompted to do so.
2. Click on your user group or list.
3. For 'New Rank Name', enter a name for your rank (for example "Youth").
4. Click 'Create New Rank'.
5. (Optional) Update the group, rank, and member permissions for this rank. These permissions affect whether members can view and/or edit any part of the group, including the group properties, its ranks or its members. If you made any modifications, click 'Update Rank'.

-----------------------------------
Add Members to Groups and Lists
-----------------------------------

Now that your user group (and ranks) are created, you need to add members to your user group. To add users: 

1. Go to https://highfidelity.com/user/groups. If you’re not logged in, you will be prompted to do so.
2. Click on your user group or list.
3. Scroll to 'Members'. 
4. For 'New Member Name', enter the username of the user you want to add.
5. Select the rank you'd like the member to have.
6. Click 'Add Member'.
