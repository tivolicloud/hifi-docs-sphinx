Maintain Domain Visitors
##########################

Occasionally, you may get users who you don't want in your domain. Whether you forgot to set the correct user permissions, or the person is being rude and uncooperative, you have the ability to silence or ban users from your domain.

.. note:: These administrative functions of silencing and banning users from a domain require the 'Kick Users' permission. Ensure you have this :doc:`user permission enabled <../configure-settings/permission-settings>` before attempting to monitor the users in your domain.

Silence a User in Your Domain
--------------------------------------------------

Many times, a visitor in your domain simply does not have the correct audio settings defined on their computer. As a result, they may output uncomfortable sounds into your domain (heavy breathing, typing, background noise, and white noise are audio issues people have when they first download High Fidelity). 

To silence a specific user in your domain: 

1. Visit your domain.
2. In Interface, pull up your Tablet or HUD and go to **People**.
3. Locate the user you would like to silence. 
4. Under the 'Admin' section, click the icon in the 'Silence' column. 

This will mute the user for everyone in the domain.

Ban a User from Your Domain
---------------------------------------------------

In some cases, a user may cause themselves to be unwelcome in your domain. 

To permanently ban a visitor from your domain:

1. Visit your domain.
2. In Interface, pull up your Tablet or HUD and go to **People**.
3. Locate the user you would like to silence. 
4. Under the 'Admin' section, click the icon in the 'Ban' column. 

The user will not be able to enter the domain using the same account; however, they will still have access to other High Fidelity domains.
