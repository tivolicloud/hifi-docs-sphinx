Backup and Restore Your Domain
######################################

We recommend that you do backups of your domain in case of data loss or griefing. While your domain server does perform automatic backups periodically of your domain's content, it is up to you to configure the frequency these backups that are performed. In addition, we recommend that you periodically download copies of these backups to your computer as a secondary backup.
