Get an Environment from the Marketplace
############################################

We and our users have designed multiple environments that are available for your use in the Marketplace. If you don't want to create your own or you want to use pre-built content sets while you're building a custom environment, then browse our Marketplace and find the perfect scene for your domain.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have rez permissions for your domain.

1. Visit your domain by its place name or IP address.
2. Pull up your Tablet or HUD and go to **Market**.
3. Under 'Categories', choose 'Environments'.
4. You'll see a list of different environments available. Click on the cost to purchase the item.
5. Confirm your purchase and click 'Get Item'.
6. Click 'Replace Content Set' to overwrite the current content set with the one you purchased.

.. note:: Rezzing this content set will replace all of the existing content in your domain. If you want to save the current state of your domain, `create a backup <export-content.html>`_ before proceeding. You can restore backup files at any time.

7. Click 'Confirm'.

At this point, your domain server will restart and the new content will be deployed in your domain.
