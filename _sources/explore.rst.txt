High Fidelity is a metaverse where you can connect and create with others. We invite you to explore VR worlds created in High Fidelity and interact with other users. You can visit your friend's VR world, meet people, attend events and even go for a class on avatar creation. It's an immersive and interactive experience with realistic visuals and audio.

If its your first time using High Fidelity, you'll start your journey a local space by yourself, where you can experiment with the controls and learn about the product. When you are ready, try exploring other domains using the GoTo and socialize with people around the metaverse. If you've visited High Fidelity before, you will return to the location where you last visited. 

Throughout this chapter, learn how to make the most of your exploration:
