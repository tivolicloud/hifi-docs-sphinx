----------------------
General Rules
----------------------

+ The Marketplace Admin Team will have the final say on the publishing of all content.
+ Any content that follows all technical rules may still be rejected if it has severe quality issues.
+ Any content attempting to exploit loopholes or work around these rules will be rejected.

.. note:: Content found to infringe on copyrights and content found to be malicious after being accepted will be invalidated. This will halt all access to the item and it will no longer be available for purchase or rezzing.

----------------------
Presentation
----------------------

**Preview Image**

A preview image must be included with all items. 

+ Preview images must clearly show what is included in the package. Images providing context (avatars holding the item, nice backgrounds etc.) are permitted as long as it is still clear what the item is. 
+ If the item doesn't have visual elements, the preview image must show context for the functionality of the item (e.g. including an image of a VR controller for a script that adds controller functionality).

**Description Text**

The description text must clearly state what is included in the item and describe all relevant functionality. 

+ Descriptions must be in English and use proper grammar, spelling, and capitalization. 
+ The Marketplace Admin Team may make minor modifications to the description for corrections or to provide clarity. 

**Titles**

Item titles must be properly capitalized and only include the item name. 

+ Do not include subtext, taglines, or descriptive text in your title; these belong in the description text. This includes adding your username to the title as branding.

---------------------
Documentation
---------------------

+ Any item that requires any kind of setup, special functionality, or important technical information must include documentation. This can be included in the description text and/or appear for the user when the item is rezzed in High Fidelity. 
+ If your item requires any :doc:`special rez permissions <../host/configure-settings/permission-settings>`, this must be included in the documentation
