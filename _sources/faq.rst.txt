| The Marketplace content I purchased has disappeared. Where did it go?                               |
+=====================================================================================================+
| Marketplace items behave like items in the real world. You can have only one copy of each item you  |
| purchase. An item you bought from the Marketplace will disappear if you rez it elsewhere. This is   |
| done using a process called `Dynamic Domain Verification (DDV) <#q11>`_.                            |

| Can I rez multiple copies of a Marketplace item?                                                    |
+=====================================================================================================+
| Yes, only if the seller has given permission to do so. A seller can modify settings to allow        |
| users to `rez multiple copies <sell/add-item.html#unlimited-rezzing-of-your-item>`_ of their item   |
| in a single domain. Otherwise, you will need to buy multiple copies of the item.                    |
| Marketplace items behave like items in the real world. You can have only one copy of each item you  |
| purchase unless specified by the seller.                                                            |

| What is Dynamic Domain Verification (DDV)?                                                          |
+=====================================================================================================+
| Dynamic Domain Verification (DDV) is a process running on your domain, which ensures that you can   |
| rez only one copy of each item purchased on the Marketplace. This is done to protect the            |
| intellectual property rights of the creators. DDV will determine if an item has been moved to a new |
| domain and will remove it from the old domain. DDV requires the domain to be running and will       |
| delete items from domains with no Place or domain name. Temporary names are accepted.               |
| DDV often runs within an hour after you rez a Marketplace item again. Its frequency is controlled   |
| by the domain's control panel.                                                                      |

|                                                                                                     |
| What happens to my Marketplace content when I change my domain ID?                                  |
+=====================================================================================================+
| When you change your domain ID, it's the same as creating a new domain. Even though the existing    |
| content may temporarily appear in the new domain, the system considers the Marketplace items as     |
| existing on the old domain. DDV will remove the Marketplace items from the new domain. You will     |
| have to rez the items again in the new domain.                                                      |

| What happens to my Marketplace content when I export a backup to another domain?                    |
+=====================================================================================================+
| When you restore a backup or exported domain onto a new server with a different domain ID, DDV will |
| consider the Marketplace item as belonging to the old domain, and will delete them from the new     |
| domain. You will have to rez the Marketplace items again in the new domain.                         |

+=====================================================================================================+
| You are free to price your item however youâ€™d like. We encourage you to consider these questions:   |
|                                                                                                     |
| * How are other items of similar quality in this category priced?                                   |
| * Are you choosing a price that you feel reflects the time and effort required to create the item?  |
|   Donâ€™t sell yourself short!                                                                        |
| * If you have multiple items for sale on the Marketplace, in essence you have a brand. Do you have  |
|   a specific target audience in mind? New users? Users looking for something truly unique? Take     |
|   this into account.                                                                                |
| * Is your item a limited edition? If an item is of good quality and in limited supply, it may       |
|   merit a higher price.                                                                             |

| We do not have a hard poly limit on avatars, however we recommend keeping avatars under 80k.        |
| Consider normal mapping your models to preserve high detail rather than excessive poly counts.      |

+=====================================================================================================+
| * For cloud domains, you can reset the username and password to a temporary one through your High   |
|   Fidelity account settings. To do so, go to https://metaverse.highfidelity.com/user/cloud_domains  |
|   and log in if prompted. Click the "More Options" menu (3 dots on the right-side of the row), then |
|   click 'Reset Domain Server password'. Once the username and password are reset, log in to your    |
|   domain settings with the temporary credentials. We recommend `setting a new username and password |
|   <host/configure-settings/authentication-setting.html>`_ at this time.                             |
| * For local servers, the authentication settings for your domain are encrypted into a configuration |
|   file on the local server's file system. To 'reset' the authentication settings, you need to       |
|   manually remove the HTTP security settings ('http_password' and 'http_username') from             |
|   config.json. The config file is stored on the server in the following directories:                |
|                                                                                                     |

| Why do Marketplace items keep disappearing from my domain?                                          |
+=====================================================================================================+
| All Marketplace items are certified to protect the intellectual property rights of the content      |
| creators. In many cases, your content is removed by a process called Dynamic Domain Verification    |
| (DDV) to prevent illegal use of your purchased items. DDV often runs within an hour after you rez   |
| a Marketplace item.                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                     |
| Here are some reasons your Marketplace items may disappear from your domain:                        |
|                                                                                                     |
| 1. Most Marketplace items can only be rezzed once. When you a second copy of the item, the original |
|    copy will immediately be removed.                                                                |
| 2. Some items are "unlimited", meaning that you can rez as many as you'd like *in the same domain*. |
|    However, as soon as you rez that same purchased item in a different domain, all earlier          |
|    instances will disappear.                                                                        |
| 3. All purchased content is protected to a single domain that is identified by its domain ID, not   |
|    its place name. This means that if you move your content to a different domain and fire up the   |
|    new domain (same place name, but now it has a different domain ID), it will not match the        |
|    "rezzed" domain and will be deleted.                                                             |
| 4. If you are hosting a domain on a local server, you must :doc:`purchase a place name              |
|    <host/configure-settings/place-setting>` for your domain before you can rez any Marketplace      |
|    content.                                                                                         |
| 5. Ensure that your :doc:`user permissions <host/configure-settings/permission-settings>` are set   |
|    up correctly. Any items that are rezzed by users with the 'Rez Temporary' permission will        |
|    disappear after a while.                                                                         |
| 6. The **Create** app lets you change the 'Collision Shape' and 'Server Scripts' properties. When   |
|    you change these properties, it changes the entity's certificate signature and invalidates the   |
|    rezzed item. These items will be removed automatically from your domain.                         |

| If you cannot connect to your virtual workplace, follow these steps to resolve the issue:           |
|                                                                                                     |
| 1. Check your internet connection, and ensure that your bandwidth is at least 10Mbps download,      |
|    2Mbps upload.                                                                                    |
| 2. You may not have permissions to enter the domain. If you know the domain owner, contact them to  |
|    gain access to the domain.                                                                       |
| 3. Ensure that your firewall settings allow you to run High Fidelity.                               |
|                                                                                                     |
|      * For Windows: In your firewall settings, open the  port 40102, and add 'interface.exe' to the |

| If other users in the domain can't hear you, then you are likely muted or your microphone gain is   |
| set too low. Here are some steps to troubleshoot your issue:                                        |
|                                                                                                     |
| 1. **Are you muted in High Fidelity?** When logged in, check the upper left corner. If you're       |
|    muted, click the microphone to un-mute yourself.                                                 |
| 2. **Is your physical output device muted or turned off?** Some headsets and microphones have a     |
|    'Power' and/or 'Mute' switch directly on the device itself. This setting is completely           |
|    independent of High Fidelity's mute option, so even if you're not muted in High Fidelity, your   |
|    device itself may not be turned on or the mute button may have been pressed.Â                     |

|    .. image:: explore/_images/headsets.png                                                          |
|                                                                                                     |
| 3. **Is your mic muted or disabled on your computer?** Lastly, your device might be muted or        |
|    disabled by your operating system. Check your operating system's input device settings:          |
|                                                                                                     |
|     a. On Windows, go to **Control Panel > Sound > Recording**Â tab. Choose the device you are using |
|        with High Fidelity and clickÂ 'Properties'. On theÂ 'Levels' tab, check the icon next to the   |
|        volume meter. The microphone icon will tell you whether your headset/microphone is           |
|        muted. If you're muted, click the icon to un-mute yourself.                                  |
|     b. On Mac, go to **System Preferences > Sound > Input**Â tab. Choose the device you are using    |
|        with High Fidelity. If the 'Input volume' is turned all of the way down, then your input     |
|        device is disabled. Turn up the input volume to re-enable your microphone.                   |
| 4. **Have you allowed High Fidelity access to the microphone?**Â Some operating systems require you  |
|    to give explicit permission to apps to take advantage of specific hardware or software           |
|    capabilities on your computer. Check your microphone permissions in your operating system        |
|    settings:                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                     |
|     a. On Windows, go toÂ **Settings > Privacy > Microphone**. Make sure that 'Allow desktop apps to |
|        access your microphone' is turned on.Â                                                        |
|     b. On Mac, go toÂ **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy**, then select             |
|        'Microphone'. Ensure that the checkbox next to High Fidelity is selected.                    |
|                                                                                                     |
| If your input device is turned on, and you are not muted in the application, device, or operating   |
| system, then it is likely that your microphone volume needs to be adjusted or boosted. This is done |
| in your operating system settings:Â                                                                  |
|                                                                                                     |
| * On Windows, go to **Control Panel > Sound > Recording**Â tab. Choose the device you are using with |
|   High Fidelity and clickÂ 'Properties'. On the 'Levels' tab, adjust the 'Microphone Level' and/or   |
|   'Microphone Boost'.                                                                               |
| * On Mac, go to **System Preferences > Sound > Input**Â tab. Choose the device you are using with    |
|   High Fidelity and adjust the 'Input volume'.Â                                                      |

| Here are some reasons you might not have audio:                                                     |
|                                                                                                     |
| * Your headset or speakers are turned off.Â                                                          |
| * Your headset or speakers may be muted or disabled by your operating system. Check your operating  |
|   system's output device settings:                                                                  |
|                                                                                                     |
|     * On Windows, click the volume icon in the taskbar and select your audio device. TheÂ speaker    |
|       icon will tell you whether or not your headset or speakers are disabled. Click the icon to    |
|       un-mute yourself.                                                                             |
|     * On Mac,Â go to **System Preferences > Sound > Output** tab. Choose the device you are using    |
|       with High Fidelity. At the bottom of the dialog, uncheck 'Mute' to un-mute yourself.          |
| * Your headset or speakers have a volume control of their own. Check that the volume is turned up   |
|   on the device.                                                                                    |
| * In High Fidelity, you have a different audio device selected than the one you want to use. Open   |
|   the **Audio** app and make sure the right headset, speakers, and/or microphone are selected.      |
| * Volume is turned down or off in High Fidelity. Open the **Audio** appÂ and check your volume       |
|   settings.                                                                                         |
