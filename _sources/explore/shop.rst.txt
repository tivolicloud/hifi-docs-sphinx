Buy High Fidelity Coin

Currently, you can buy High Fidelity Coins (HFC) using `Ethereum <https://www.ethereum.org>`_, a blockchain app that trades ETH (Ether). The Bank of High Fidelity manages HFC and we gradually increase the number of coins in circulation as the economy grows. 100 HFC is equal to 1 USD.

To get HFC: 

1. `Book an appointment <https://meetings.hubspot.com/highfidelity/high-fidelity-bank-appointment>`_ at the Bank of High Fidelity.
2. At the time of your appointment, visit the `TradingRoom <https://hifi.place/TradingRoom>`_ domain.
3. We will provide you with a QR code that you can use to send ETH to the Bank of High Fidelity. 
4. Once we receive the ETH amount you sent, we will send you the appropriate amount of HFC to your account based on the current exchange rate. This can take up to one business day. 

You can also receive HFC from gifts from your friends or as prizes at events in High Fidelity.

Cash Out Your HFC
-----------------------------

As you acquire more HFC through Marketplace sales, prizes, or gifts, you may cash out your HFC for USD. The minimum amount of HFC that you cash out is $25 (or 2,500 HFC), and the maximum cashout value is $2000 (or 200,000 HFC) per calendar month. High Fidelity may, at its discretion, issue the occasional exception to the maximum cashout amount.

To cash out HFC: 

1. `Book an appointment <https://meetings.hubspot.com/highfidelity/high-fidelity-bank-appointment>`_ at the Bank of High Fidelity.
2. At the time of your appointment, visit the `TradingRoom <https://hifi.place/TradingRoom>`_ domain to meet with the banker.
