Give and Receive Gifts
#########################################

Just like in real life, you can give money or presents to your friends in High Fidelity. You may wish to gift an item to a friend, send money to a connection, have a VIP zone in your domain, or play a poker game with your friends. 

With the Commerce API, you can also award money or items using a coupon. A *coupon* is a way to send HFC or items to someone at a later time, even when you are not logged in to High Fidelity. For example, you can create a coupon to award the winner of a trivia game 250 HFC, or to give someone a soda when they buy something from a vending machine.

Create a Coupon
-----------------------------------------

You can create a coupon when you want to send money or an item to someone at a later time, even when you are not logged in to High Fidelity.

.. note:: Currently, you can only use a coupon in a script. You will not be able to redeem a coupon anywhere in Interface. 

1. In Interface, pull up your tablet or HUD and go to **Inventory**.
2. Choose whether you'd like to later send HFC or an item.

	* If you want to send HFC, click 'Send Money'.
	* If you want to send an item, click 'Items' and scroll to the item you'd like to give. Click on the item's menu and choose 'Gift'.

3. Select 'Create Coupon'.
4. Enter an optional public message explaining the purpose of the coupon. 
5. The Tablet will now display a window with the 'Authorization ID' and 'Coupon ID'. Copy both these values on your computer. Click 'Close'.
6. Include the copied values in a :doc:`script where another user receives the HFC or item <../script/transfer-hfc-tutorial>`.

**Example: Use a Coupon to Hold a Raffle**  

Say you want to pre-authorize 10 of your High Fidelity Coins to be paid out to a user who wins a raffle that you host. In this example, `curl <https://curl.haxx.se/>`_ is used to perform the redemption. But you can redeem a pre-authorized transfer using any script or tool that can perform `HTTP PUT` requests, such as High Fidelity Interface's `request` JavaScript module or a simple PHP form on a website.

1. `Create a Coupon`_ to get an 'Authorization ID' and 'Coupon ID' value pair associated with a 10-HFC Pre-Authorized Money transfer.
2. Copy and paste the 'Authorization ID' and 'Coupon ID' to a text file on your computer.
3. Click 'Close', then 'I'm All Set'.
4. Hold your raffle! In this example, a user with username `steve` has won the raffle.
5. Use the following ``curl`` command from the command line to dispense the money authorized in (1) to username `steve`:
   ``curl -X PUT -d authorization_id="<authorization ID from 1>" -d coupon_id="<coupon ID from 1>" -d username=steve https://highfidelity.com/api/v1/commerce/redeem``
