Install High Fidelity
###########################

High Fidelity has two different installers. The *Client Installer* comes with everything you need to view and interact with High Fidelity's content and users. However, you are unable to host content using this installer. The *Client + Sandbox Installer* has everything the client installer does, but it also enables you to :doc:`host your own content <../../host>` and share it with the world.

--------------------------------
Minimum System Requirements
--------------------------------

In order to run High Fidelity in either VR or Desktop mode, ensure that your computer meets these minimum system requirements: 

* Windows 10, 64-bit or MacOS High Sierra (10.13)
* 8GB+ RAM i5
* A wide range of Nvidia, AMD, and Intel graphics cards are supported

In addition, your network must have enough internet bandwidth to run High Fidelity:

* If you are using Interface only to explore the metaverse, then you must have internet speeds of at least **10 Mbps download/2 Mbps** upload.
* If you are hosting a domain on your Sandbox, you need to add **10 Mbps** upload for each user you want to concurrently visit your domain. 

.. note:: We also run on Linux devices; however, we do not publish an installer for Linux machines. To use High Fidelity on Linux, you will need to build the application from our code base. For more information, see our `Linux Build Guide <https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi/blob/master/BUILD_LINUX.md>`_.
