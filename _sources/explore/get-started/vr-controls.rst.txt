Use Your VR Equipment
#########################

To get the best and most immersive experience in High Fidelity, we encourage you to use VR equipment, such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. With these HMD devices and hand controllers, you will be able to interact with people in 3D, track body movements, and engage with the objects around you. We support the following VR equipment: 

+------------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Head Mounted Displays                          | Hand Controllers    |
+================================================+=====================+
| Oculus Rift (CV1 and S)                        | Oculus Touch        |
+------------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| HTC Vive                                       | HTC Vive            |
+------------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Windows MR                                     | XBox One Controller |

Comfort Mode
------------------------

Motion sickness is a real problem for many people when they put on a HMD and enter VR. This happens because your eyes experience movement in VR, while your body stands still. If you experience motion sickness and discomfort using VR equipment, you are not alone. 

"Comfort mode" is designed to decrease the effects of motion sickness while using High Fidelity. This mode:

* Disables sharp turns 
* Decreases your field of vision by darkening the edges of the screen
* Adds a ground plane and grid

All of these features were developed to help you orient yourself when moving around in VR.

To enable comfort mode, go to **Menu > Settings > Controls** on your tablet. Use the slider to adjust how much of the environment you see in VR.

Change How You Move in VR
-----------------------------

You can change many avatar movement settings in VR such as jumping, flying, and leaning behavior. To do so:

* In Desktop mode, go to **Settings > Controls** in the menu bar.
* In VR mode, open your Tablet and go to **Menu > Settings > Controls**.

Motion Capture Using Vive Trackers
------------------------------------------

You can enhance your High Fidelity experience using full body motion capture (mocap). High Fidelity currently supports mocap using HTC Vive Trackers. 

Vive trackers need to be strapped to the body part you wish to track. You can replace the HMD and hand controllers with trackers if you only need to track the movement of your head and hands. 

You can set up different mocap systems:

+---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Mocap System        | Equipment Needed         | Recommended Straps                                      |
+=====================+==========================+=========================================================+
| Head                | HMD or 1 Vive Tracker    | Head strap for Vive Tracker                             |
+---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Hands               | Hand controllers or      | Hand strap for Vive Tracker                             |
|                     | 2 Vive Trackers          |                                                         |

| Feet + Hips +       | 2 Hand Controllers       |                                                         |
| Shoulders           |                          |                                                         |

.. note:: You can replace the HMD and hand controllers with trackers if you only need to track the movement of your head and hands.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configure Your Mocap System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Strap your Vive trackers to your body as shown in the image.
2. Connect your trackers, HMD, and controllers to SteamVR.
3. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Menu > Settings > Calibration**.
4. Configure your mocap system by:

   * Selecting the right device for your head and hands. If you're using a head tracker instead of an HMD, click 'Use HTC Vive Devices in Desktop Mode'.
   * Selecting the body position of any additional trackers. 
   
   .. image:: _images/vive-config.PNG
   
5. Click 'Apply and Calibrate'.
6. Stand in a T-Pose until the timer counts down to zero:

   * Feet together
   * Arms out
   * Head looking straight ahead.
   
7. Check to see that each tracker is tracking the corresponding joint on your avatar. 
8. You can also calibrate your trackers without using your tablet. Once you apply your configuration, stand in a T-Pose and hold the following four buttons together for 1 second: Left Trigger, Right Trigger, Left Menu Button, Right Menu Button. You can press the same buttons together for a second to remove your calibration from the trackers.

.. note:: When you setup your Vive, you choose which way to point the arrow as your reference. During calibration,  it is important that you face the same direction. If you can not remember the arrow's direction, press the Vive System Menu Button and look on the ground for a marker. This is important to make sure your joints are oriented correctly.

|                                 |   number of trackers to support that configuration?                                       |
|                                 | * If you are performing and not in HMD, did you select to 'Use HTC Vive in Desktop Mode'? |
|                                 | * Are any of the trackers blinking? If so, they may need to be paired again.              |
|                                 | * Do you have the correct number of dongles plugged in to your computer? You will need    |
|                                 |   one dongle per tracker. If you are performing with all 7, then you may need a USB hub   |
|                                 |   to handle them.                                                                         |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| My sensor is jiggling a lot     | Make sure the straps on the sensor are tightened.                                         |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| My sensor keeps losing tracking | * If it’s the hip tracker, is your shirt is tucked in and not covering the puck? Also     |
|                                 |   make sure your headphone cord isn’t covering the puck.                                  |
|                                 | * Can the base stations clearly see the tracker?                                          |
|                                 | * Is the signal from the base station conflicting with another Vive setup nearby?         |
|                                 | * Are you clear of reflective surfaces nearby? (such as picture frames, whiteboards,      |
|                                 |   shiny tables).                                                                          |
|                                 | * Is the lighting consistent across the room (minimal outdoor lighting)?                  |
|                                 | * Try restarting SteamVR.                                                                 |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: Remember to charge your trackers when you aren't using them so that you don't have to deal with a low battery tracker negatively impacting your performance.

-------------------------
Gamepad
-------------------------

If your HMD does not come equipped with hand controllers, you can use a gamepad. However, High Fidelity is best experienced with VR equipment or the keyboard in Desktop mode.
