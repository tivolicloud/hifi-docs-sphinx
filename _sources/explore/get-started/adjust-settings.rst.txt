The Tablet and HUD
------------------------

In VR, all of your settings are found in your **Tablet**. The Tablet also gives you easy access to any :doc:`apps that you install <../personalize/install-apps>`. Pull up the tablet by clicking the menu button on your controller.

In Desktop Mode, you have the option to use either the Tablet or a smaller version called the "Heads-up Display" or HUD. It contains the exact same options as the Tablet (settings, apps, etc), but it takes up less space on your screen. To enable the HUD, first enable the **Developer** menu by going to **Settings > Developer Menu**. Then, go to **Developer > UI > Desktop Tablet Becomes Toolbar**.

Enter or Exit VR Mode
------------------------------

You can enjoy High Fidelity with or with VR equipment such as head mounted displays (HMD), hand controllers and audio headsets. Our Desktop mode contains many of High Fidelity's features such as audio, basic movements and gestures, and the ability to travel to different domains. 

Keep in mind, however, that the most immersive and powerful experience is when you use VR equipment. Only then will you be able to interact with people in 3D, track body movements, and easily engage with the objects around you. Once you have set up your VR equipment, you can easily switch between VR mode and Desktop mode. To switch to VR mode, use one of the following methods: 

1. From the HUD, click **Enter VR**.
2. Click the **Display** menu, then select your VR device. 

To exit from VR mode, remove your headset, click **Exit VR** on the HUD or press ``ESC`` on your keyboard.
