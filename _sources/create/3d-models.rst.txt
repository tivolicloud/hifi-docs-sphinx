3D Models

3D models are :doc:`entities <entities>` that represent objects you'd like to see in-world such as a water fountain, a castle, or a coffee mug. You can get your 3D model by creating your own, sourcing it externally, or purchasing them from our `Marketplace <../explore/shop.html#shopping-the-marketplace>`_. We only support 3D models in the OBJ and FBX formats.

The appearance of a 3D model is controlled by its materials. The materials supported in High Fidelity are Physically-based Rendering (PBR) materials. This means that a 3D model's materials will reflect or absorb light as they would (approximately) in real life.
